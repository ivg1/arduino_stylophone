## Installing
1. Download this repository as a zip file
2. Extract the contents into a folder (e.g. synth_keyboard)
3. Then you need to download the libraries...
4. Wire the arduino as shown here: https://wokwi.com/projects/418328757006720001
5. After that just open the .ino file and upload to the arduino
6. You're all set

## Downloading libraries
1. The notes.h library is already in this repository.
2. To download the <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h> library go to: https://github.com/fdebrabander/Arduino-LiquidCrystal-I2C-library

## Wiring of project
You can see the wiring I used for this project here: https://wokwi.com/projects/418328757006720001.
Ignore the code, it doesn't work half the time because I couldnt import libraries I used, But do look at the wiring.

### ! Attention !
I built this project using touch sensors, so if you have them please use them instead of buttons (as on the wowki).
I didn't try using buttons, so some issues might arise. So once again, if you have touch sensors, use them.
